# Handwritten-to-Text OCR

This project uses **TensorFlow** and **Keras** to train and deploy convolutional neural network (CNN) models for identifying handwritten characters. The models are trained on the **MNIST** and **EMNIST** datasets to recognize both digits and alphanumeric characters.

## Features

- **MNIST Model**: Recognizes handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset.
- **EMNIST Model**: Identifies handwritten alphanumeric characters (letters and digits) from the EMNIST dataset.
- Supports character recognition from uploaded images.

## Files

- **`mnist.ipynb`**: Digit identification using pre-set images from the MNIST dataset.
- **`emnist.ipynb`**: Alphanumeric character identification with user-uploaded images (EMNIST dataset).
